## Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Assistance
- **Multi-LLM Support** - Anthropic Claude, Grok (xAI), Groq, and Claude Code (OAuth)
- **Context-Aware** - Automatically includes relevant project files, directory structure, and more
- **Tool Execution** - AI can directly interact with your codebase through 37+ built-in tools

### 📁 Smart Context Management
- **File Context** - Open files and keep them in context for reference
- **Directory Tree** - Filtered view of your project structure (gitignore-style filtering)

## API Request Structure

This section documents how the prompt sent to the LLM is constructed.

### Message Flow Overview

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph SystemPrompt["System Prompt"]
        SP[Active Seed/System Content]
    end
    
    subgraph DynamicPanels["Dynamic Panels (as fake tool calls)"]
        direction TB
        PH[Panel Header] --> P2["[assistant] tool_use: dynamic_panel\n[user] tool_result: P2 Tree"]
        P2 --> P3["[assistant] tool_use: dynamic_panel\n[user] tool_result: P3 Todo"]
        P3 --> PN["... more panels sorted by timestamp ..."]
        PN --> PF[Panel Footer + Acknowledgment]
    end
    
    subgraph SeedReinjection["Seed Re-injection"]
        SR1["[user] System instructions repeated"]
        SR2["[assistant] Understood, I will follow..."]
    end
    
    subgraph Conversation["Conversation Messages"]
        U1["[user] [U1]: First message"]
        A1["[assistant] [A1]: First response"]
        U2["[user] [U2]: Second message"]
        AN["..."]
    end
    
    SystemPrompt --> DynamicPanels
    DynamicPanels --> SeedReinjection
    SeedReinjection --> Conversation
```

### Panel Injection (Dynamic Context)

Panels (P2-P7+) are injected as fake `tool_use`/`tool_result` pairs before the conversation. This allows the LLM to see project context as if it had called tools itself.

**Panel Order**: Sorted by `last_refresh_ms` ascending (oldest first, newest closest to conversation).

**Panel Format**:
```
======= [P2] Directory Tree =======
{tree content}
```

**Panels Excluded**: P0 (System/Seed) and P1 (Conversation) are not injected as panels.

### Message ID Format

All messages include visible IDs for the LLM to reference:

| Role | ID Format | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| User message | `[U{n}]:` | `[U1]:\nHello!` |
| Assistant response | `[A{n}]:` | `[A1]:\nHi there!` |
| Tool result | `[R{n}]:` | `[R1]:\nFile opened` |

**Note**: Tool call messages (T-blocks) don't have visible IDs due to API constraints - `tool_use` blocks cannot contain mixed text.

### Summarized Messages

When a message has `status == Summarized`:
- Uses the `tl_dr` field instead of full `content`
- Same ID format: `[A5]:\n{tl_dr text}`
- Reduces token usage while preserving context

### Tool Execution Flow

1. Assistant message includes `tool_use` blocks
2. Tools execute locally, results collected
3. Tool results sent as `tool_result` blocks in user message
4. Assistant continues with access to results
5. Process repeats if more tools are called

## Architecture

### Panel Caching System

The application uses a non-blocking caching architecture to ensure the UI remains responsive:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph MainThread["Main Thread (UI)"]
        ML[Main Loop]
        FW[File Watcher]
    end
    
    subgraph BackgroundThread["Background Thread"]
        CW[Cache Worker]
    end
    
    subgraph External["External Sources"]
        FS[File System]
        TM[Tmux Sessions]
        GG[Glob/Grep Exec]
        GT[Git Status]
    end
    
    ML -->|CacheRequest| CW
    CW -->|CacheUpdate| ML
    CW --> FS
    CW --> TM
    CW --> GG
    CW --> GT
    FW -->|"Detects changes"| ML
    ML -->|"Triggers refresh"| CW
```

**Cache Invalidation Strategies:**

| Context Type | Invalidation Method |
|--------------|---------------------|
| File | File watcher (inotify) detects changes |
| Tree | Directory watcher on open folders |
| Glob | Timer-based (30 second refresh) |
| Grep | Timer-based (30 second refresh) |
| Tmux | Timer-based (1 second) + hash of last 2 lines |
| Conversation | Internal state changes |
| Todo/Memory | Internal state changes |

**Key Properties:**
- Same cached content used for both UI rendering and LLM context
- Background threads handle all blocking I/O
- Main thread only reads from cache, never blocks
- File watchers only monitor actively open files/folders
