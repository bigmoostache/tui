//! Watcher trait and registry for asynchronous condition monitoring.
//!
//! Modules register watchers (via WatcherRegistry in State) to monitor
//! conditions like process exit, pattern matching, or timers.
//! The spine module polls the registry and fires notifications when
//! conditions are met.
