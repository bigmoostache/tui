# Context threshold notification - sent to spine when context usage crosses the intermediary cleaning threshold
context_threshold_notification: |
  Context usage has crossed the cleaning threshold ({usage_pct}% of budget, {used_tokens}/{budget_tokens} tokens).
  You should proactively manage your context to stay under the threshold:
  - Close file panels you no longer need (Close_panel)
  - Close grep/glob results that have served their purpose
  - Summarize logs if there are many top-level entries (log_summarize)
  - Close conversation history panels after extracting key information
  Review your open panels and close any that are no longer essential.
